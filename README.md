# Personal Website 2023

Hello everyone and welcome to my new website as of 2023. My personal website/portfolio is built on React.js which runs on Node 14.0 and higher.

I built this website because I believe that React.js and its capabilities are beautiful. I believe that React.js makes web applications optimal, user-friendly, and code readable.

My website is built locally and hosted on Netlify.app and you can find my website at 

```bash
Johnsonnguyen.netlify.app
```


# How to clone my website?

You can use my website by simply cloning it into your local machine. Start by running 


```bash
git clone https://github.com/johnson82nguyen/JohnNguyen2023.git
```

Once you have this cloned onto your local machine, make sure you download all dependencies on this project. To do this, you can run


```bash
npm install
```
